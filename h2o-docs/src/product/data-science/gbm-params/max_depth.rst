``max_depth``

- Available in: GBM, DRF
- Hyperparameter: yes

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

This specifies the maximum depth to which each tree will be built. This option can be used to prevent overfitting. 


You can view your tree in Flow as you are training. You can create your first model using ``max_depth=3`` as an initial tree depth to get a feel for how the tree is fitting to your data, and then increase the depth until you achieve the optimal depth.
